# Terraform AWS WAF

This module is based on [AWS WAF Security Automations](https://aws.amazon.com/cn/solutions/aws-waf-security-automations/) written in cloudformation. It is not so good for deploying cloudformation will take more than 15 min, and we use terraform writing our infrastructure.

## How does this AWS WAF Automation Solution helps?

AWS WAF is a web application firewall that will enable us to quickly create custom, application-specific rules that block common attack patterns which can affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. It will make WAF security automation easy, enabling rapid rule propagation and fast incident response.

Note: AWS offers a solution that uses AWS CloudFormation Template to automatically deploy a set of AWS WAF rules designed to filter common web-based attacks. We can select from preconfigured protective features that define the rules included in an AWS WAF web access control list (web ACL). Once the solution is deployed, AWS WAF will begin inspecting web requests to the userâ€™s existing Application Load Balancers, and block them when applicable.

## Solution overview

The AWS WAF Security Automations solution provides fine-grained control over the requests attempting to access your web application. The diagram below presents the architecture you can build using the solution's implementation guide and accompanying AWS CloudFormation template.

At the core of the design is an AWS WAF web ACL that acts as central inspection and decision point for all incoming requests. The protective functions you choose to activate will determine the custom rules that are added to your web ACL.

## AWS WAF Security Automations solution architecture

**Honeypot (A)**: This component creates a honeypot to lure and deflect content scrapers and bad bots. A discrete API Gateway endpoint (embedded in the web application) triggers a custom AWS Lambda function, which intercepts the suspicious request and adds the source IP address to the AWS WAF block list.

**SQL injection (B) and cross-site scripting (C) protection**: The solution automatically configures two native AWS WAF rules that protect against common SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) patterns in the URI, query string, or body of a request.

**Log parsing (D)**: A custom AWS Lambda function automatically parses access logs to identify suspicious behavior and add the corresponding source IP addresses to an AWS WAF block list.

**Manual IP lists (E)**: This component creates two specific AWS WAF rules that allow you to manually insert IP addresses that you want to block (blacklist) or allow (whitelist).

**IP-list parsing (F)**: A custom AWS Lambda function automatically checks third-party IP reputation lists hourly for malicious IP addresses to add to an AWS WAF block list.

**HTTP flood protection (G)**: This component configures a rate-based rule that automatically blocks web requests from a client once they exceed a configurable threshold.

## Deployment

### Assumptions/Pre-requisites

You have correctly configure your aws account, and export aws secrets as envrionment variable.
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxxx
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxxx
```

### Usage example
1. example to use alb as endpoint
```hcl
module "testalb" {
  source                                    = "../../modules/alb"
  access_log_bucket                         = "test-bucket-alb"
  aws_region                                = "ap-southeast-1"
  sql_injection_protection_activated        = "yes"
  cross_site_scripting_protection_activated = "yes"
  http_flood_protection_activated           = "yes"
  scanner_probe_protection_activated        = "yes"
  reputation_lists_protection_activated     = "yes"
  bad_bot_protection_activated              = "yes"
}

```

### Run example

Deploy WAF ACL for ALB
```
$cd examples/alb
$terraform init
$terraform plan
$terraform run
```
